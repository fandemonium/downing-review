Areas to Include in Review
* Prioritize and organize your concerns: Prioritizing helps both the author and the editor to know which major issues must be addressed, and which are minor and not as critical to the publication or revision of a paper. Provide brief statements, number and organize the suggestions, and be clear and direct.
* Be specific and give examples from the manuscript:ÿGeneral statements such as ?not a significant contribution,??clinically unimportant,? and ?poorly analyzed? are not very useful without more details. Vague reviews frustrate authors because they are forced to guess what parts of their manuscript need to be improved.
* Suggest corrective actions if possible:ÿSpecific suggestions for analysis, writing, formatting, or summarizing the information to enhance the manuscript are helpful. Point to fundamental flaws that are unlikely to be overcome.
* Be respectful of the authors:ÿScholarship is difficult and criticism is not pleasant to receive. Be fair and critical but make your comments in the tone that you would want to receive.
* Act as the expert:ÿEspecially for new reviewers, do not be shy. You were chosen because you have some expertise, either as a reader of the literature or a contributor to the field. Do not hold back. One reason for maintaining the anonymity of reviewers is that we believe it encourages frank feedback.
* Use guidelines or checklists as appropriate:ÿGuidelines are available to assist you in your review and in giving feedback to authors. Published guidelines exist for educational interventions,19meta-analysis of randomized,20ÿor observational studies,21ÿeconomic evaluations,22,23ÿdiagnostic tests studies,24ÿrandomized-controlled trials,25ÿand nonrandomized interventions.26,27
* Follow the instructions:ÿOnce you have agreed to review, stay within the timeline. It is not fair to the authors to delay. Provide scoring requested on the reviewer's report form such as appropriateness to the audience, scientific rigor, and clarity of the writing. Also, indicate or suggest whether the manuscript is appropriate for an editorial. Maintain confidentiality and describe any conflicts of interest.
* Be frank when making confidential comments to the editor:ÿThis section allows you to make comments that the author does not see. Unlike the comments returned to the authors, these comments may include your opinions about whether the manuscript is ultimately worth publishing. Comments made to the author are not worth repeating in this section.
* Do not convey different messages to the author and editor:ÿIt is confusing and sometimes even hurtful to an author to have a reviewer ?be kind? or even positive in his or her comments to the author and harsh (rejecting the manuscript) to the editor. It may create a communication problem that the editor will need to fix. Provide unbridled but accurate, constructive criticism to the author.
