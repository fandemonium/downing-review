Perspectives (formerly called Viewpoints)ÿdescribe a considered view about
one or more issues in academic medicine, propose and support a new hypothesis, or theorize
the implications of as-yet unimplemented programs or innovations. Perspectives must be scholarlyÿand arguments must be well-supported, but these articles can function as opinion pieces.ÿThey generally have few tables and figures, if any.
Commentariesÿare solicited opinion essays that comment on or set the context for anÿarticle or articles that have been accepted for publication. They can also be stand-alone essaysÿframed as calls to action on major challenges. Commentaries have few references and rely heavilyÿon the author's perspective and experience to support the argument. They should be less thanÿ2,000 words and generally have few tables and figures, if any.
Point-Counterpointsÿare page-long, invited articles (750 words). Like commentaries,ÿthey may respond to an accepted article, or may explore two or more sides of an issue. Theyÿgenerally have few tables and figures, if any.
