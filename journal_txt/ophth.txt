Are the conclusions appropriate? For instance, can the authors justifiably claim that a
treatment is “
safe
?
”
To detect an unexpected serious adverse event that occurs 1% of the
time a sample size of 300 is needed. A samp
le size of 100 can find 3% rates.

Are claims overstated
? Is there marketing or “hype” embedded in the text? The data
should be clearly spelled out b
ut it is best for
readers to interpret it without the b
enefit of
embedded “spin” from
authors.
Is the content in correct
sections of the manuscript? For exampl
e,
are discussion
comments in the results section or are methods and results mixed up?
For experimental studies, is the material understand
able to non
-
scientist readers?
Is there
adequate detail in the methods section that would allow someone skilled in t
he field to
replicate the work?
Tables and figures take a lot of space. Are they as clear
as they can be?
Are all needed?
Could some tables or figures be moved online only?
Material should not be duplicated. If
the authors give data in a table, it need
not be reiterated in the text or vice versa.
References should include pertinent material
and need not be encyclopedic
.
Twenty or 30
references suffice for the majority of manuscripts and nearly all can be presented with less
than 40.
Did the authors
select the appropriate material to cite? Note that when the
authors are claiming priority such as “the first case of ...” it is not adequate
simply to say
“we did a PubMed search...” Details
on the depth and breadth of the literature review
should be include
d.
Meaningful peer review is time

advice.
Thoughtful

provide better
